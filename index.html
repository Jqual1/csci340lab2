            The knot.
            A knot is used to make things more secure.
            A knot can be used to tie a rope to itself or to tie two ropes together.
            The better the knot the more secure it is.
            But if the knot is in a hose, then the situation can be dire.
            Knots in a hose can stop the flow of water.
            A good knot can keep you attached to a rope, dangling safety over the side of a building.
            A bad knot will make you come lose and fall.
            As a firefighter, you must know the following things.
          </p>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <h2>Firefighters must:</h2>
              <li>
                make sure there are no knots in their hoses. Knots = Loss!!
              </li>
              <li>
                make sure their knots are secure before scaling a building. Bad Knots = Loss!!
              </li>
              <li>
                make sure to never tie a knot in an oxygen tube. Knots = Loss!!
              </li>
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="middle col">

            A firefighter is fighting fires to save lives.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="middle col">
          <p>
            <h3>Knot <br>
            <img width="400" src="images/Knot.jpg">
            </h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes they need to tie knots and other times knots are a burden.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="middle col">
          <p>
            <h3>Loss <br>
            <img width="400" src="images/Grave.jpg">
            </h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            We understand that sometimes it is easy to ignore simple safety precautions,
            but remember that great loss can come from something as simple as a knot.
